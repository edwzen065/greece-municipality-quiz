# greece-municipality-quiz
Download the whole folder "greeceMunicipalityQuiz" because it contains the data as well as the code. Using the .ipynb in a python notebook is recommended, but .py should work as well.

For .ipynb:
After you run the code, it will show two maps of the municipality. You can guess the municipality or type "stop" to stop the program.

For .py:
The program will show two maps of the municipality. Close the maps after viewing them; then guess the municipality. Type "stop" to stop the program.
